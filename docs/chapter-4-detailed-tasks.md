-   [ ] **Lesson 3: Building Scenes with Python Scripting**
    -   [ ] Write markdown content explaining the Python API and the role of the Nucleus server.
    -   [ ] Develop the full `create_lab.py` script to programmatically generate a scene with walls and a Nucleus-based light source.
    -   [ ] Include comments in the script explaining each major step.

-   [ ] **Lesson 4: Importing and Controlling a Robot**
    -   [ ] Write markdown content explaining URDF import and the two control methods (native API vs. ROS 2 bridge).
    -   [ ] Provide the Python code snippet for using the `URDFImporter`.
    -   [ ] Provide the Python code snippet for adding the `ROS2PublishJointState` and `ROS2SubscribeJointState` components.

-   [ ] **Lesson 6: High-Performance Stereo Vision**
    -   [ ] Write markdown content explaining the stereo vision pipeline (rectification, disparity).
    -   [ ] Provide the Isaac Sim Python code for adding a stereo camera pair to the robot.
    -   [ ] Develop the ROS 2 launch file (`stereo_proc.launch.py`) that includes the Isaac ROS pipeline and correctly remaps the topics.

    -   [ ] Provide clear installation instructions for Isaac Orbit.
    -   [ ] Document the command to run the Franka example, explaining the `--num_envs` argument.

-   [ ] **Lesson 9: Creating a Custom RL Environment**
    -   [ ] Write markdown content explaining the structure of an `RLTaskEnv` class.
    -   [ ] Provide the skeleton `MyHumanoidReachEnv` class.
    -   [ ] Implement the `_setup_scene`, `_get_observations`, and `_get_rewards` methods with detailed comments.

    -   [ ] Write markdown content explaining PPO and the purpose of the `train.py` script.
    -   [ ] Explain how to use TensorBoard to monitor training and what the key graphs mean.
    -   [ ] Provide the exact command to launch the training for the custom reach environment.

-   [ ] **Lesson 11: Deploying the Trained Policy & Capstone**
    -   [ ] Write markdown content explaining the `play.py` script and the concept of emergent behavior.
    -   [ ] Formally define the Balancing Humanoid capstone project, detailing the state, action, and reward function.
    -   [ ] Provide guidance on how to test the final policy by applying external forces in the simulator.
