# Glossary

This glossary contains definitions for key terms used throughout the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## A

**Actuator**: A component of a robot responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system.

## B

**Bipedal Locomotion**: The ability to walk on two legs, a key challenge in humanoid robotics.

## C

**Control System**: A system that manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems.

## D

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**: The number of independent movements a mechanical device can make.

## E

**Embodiment**: The concept of AI having a physical form to interact with the environment.

## G

**Gait**: The pattern of movement of the limbs of legged creatures, especially in walking or running.

## I

**Inverse Kinematics**: The mathematical process of calculating the variable joint parameters needed to place the end of a kinematic chain.

## P

**Physical AI**: Intelligent systems that interact with, perceive, and act upon the real world through a physical body.

## R

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**: Flexible framework for writing robot software providing hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, and more.

## S

**Sim-to-Real Gap**: The challenge of transferring skills learned in simulation to the real world.

## T

**Task Space**: The space in which the task is naturally described, e.g., Cartesian space for end-effector position.
