  - **Activity:** Discussion: How does having a body change what AI can learn or do?

- **Lesson 2: Components of Physical AI Systems.**
  - **Topics:** Hardware (sensors, actuators, processing units, power), Software (real-time operating systems, control algorithms, perception stacks, planning algorithms), AI methodologies (machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning).
  - **Activity:** Analyze a modern humanoid robot's architecture (e.g., Boston Dynamics' Atlas) and identify its key components.

- **Lesson 3: Historical Context and Milestones.**
  - **Topics:** Early cybernetics, first robotic arms, walking robots, AI winter, resurgence of robotics and AI, key historical humanoid projects (e.g., ASIMO, WABOT, HRP series).
  - **Activity:** Timeline creation: Students map key developments in AI and robotics, specifically noting advances in humanoid forms.

- **Lesson 4: Introduction to Humanoid Robotics.**
  - **Topics:** Bipedal locomotion challenges (balance, dynamic stability), dexterous manipulation, human-robot interaction design, the unique role of humanoids in bridging AI to the physical world.
  - **Assignment:** Research and write a short report (250-300 words) on a specific historical milestone in Physical AI or a current humanoid robotics project, highlighting its contribution to bridging digital AI to physical robotics.

### Week 2: Navigating the Landscape of Humanoid AI
- **Lesson 5: Key Challenges in Physical AI.**
  - **Topics:** The "sim-to-real" gap, real-time processing demands, robust hardware design, energy efficiency, safety in human-robot collaboration, dealing with uncertainty in the physical world.
  - **Activity:** Group brainstorming: Identify potential failure modes for a humanoid robot performing a simple household task.

- **Lesson 6: AI-Powered Perception for Humanoids.**
  - **Topics:** Vision (object recognition, pose estimation, semantic segmentation), tactile sensing (force feedback, grasp stability), auditory processing, proprioception (joint angles, forces).
  - **Activity:** Discuss how different sensor modalities contribute to a humanoid's understanding of its environment for a given task (e.g., pouring water).

- **Lesson 7: AI-Powered Control and Decision-Making.**
  - **Topics:** Whole-body control, inverse kinematics/dynamics, reactive control vs. deliberative planning, learning from demonstration (LfD), reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic tasks like walking and manipulation.
  - **Activity:** Compare and contrast traditional control methods with AI-driven approaches for bipedal locomotion.

- **Lesson 8: Applications of Physical AI.**
  - **Topics:** Manufacturing and logistics, healthcare (assistive robots, surgery), exploration (disaster relief, space), service industries (hospitality, retail), education, entertainment.
  - **Activity:** Case study: Analyze a successful (or aspiring) application of humanoid robots in a specific industry.

- **Lesson 9: Ethical Considerations in Humanoid Robotics.**
  - **Topics:** Job displacement, privacy, accountability in autonomous decision-making, potential for misuse, human-robot social implications, anthropomorphism.
  - **Capstone Project:** Students will propose a novel application for a humanoid robot using Physical AI. This proposal should identify a real-world problem, explain how a humanoid robot with specific Physical AI capabilities would solve it, outline the major technical challenges, and address potential ethical implications. The proposal should be a 1-page executive summary.
