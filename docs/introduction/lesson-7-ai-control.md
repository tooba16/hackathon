Once a humanoid robot perceives its environment, it needs to decide what to do and how to execute those actions. This is where AI-powered control and decision-making come into play, translating high-level goals into low-level motor commands that achieve complex physical behaviors.

## 1. Whole-Body Control (WBC)

Humanoid robots have many joints (high degrees of freedom, DoF) and operate in complex environments. WBC is a control framework that simultaneously coordinates all the robot's joints to achieve multiple tasks while respecting physical constraints.

-   **Challenges:**
    -   **Redundancy:** With many DoF, there are often infinite ways to achieve a single task (e.g., reaching a point). WBC must choose the "best" way based on other priorities.
    -   **Priorities:** Tasks often have different priorities (e.g., maintain balance > avoid collision > reach target).
    -   **Constraints:** Joint limits, torque limits, contact forces, friction cones.
-   **AI Enhancements:**
    -   **Learning Cost Functions:** AI can learn more effective weighting for different tasks or constraints based on experience or human demonstration.
    -   **Predictive Control:** Using learned models to predict future states and optimize control inputs over a horizon.

## 2. Dynamic Locomotion

Moving efficiently and stably on two legs is a hallmark of humanoid capabilities, and AI is increasingly enabling more natural and robust gaits.

-   **Gait Generation:** Generating the sequence of joint movements that constitute walking, running, or stair climbing.
    -   **AI Techniques:**
        -   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Training an agent to learn optimal gaits directly by rewarding stable, fast, or energy-efficient movement. This has been used to achieve highly dynamic behaviors like running and parkour.
        -   **Optimization-based Methods:** Using AI/optimization to find gaits that minimize energy or maximize stability given the robot's dynamics.
-   **Balance Control:** Maintaining an upright posture and recovering from disturbances.
    -   **AI Techniques:**
        -   **Learned State Estimators:** Combining IMU, joint encoder, and force plate data using neural networks to get a robust estimate of the robot's Center of Mass (CoM) and Center of Pressure (CoP).
        -   **Learned Perturbation Recovery:** RL policies trained to quickly react to pushes or slips.

## 3. Manipulation and Dexterity

Interacting with objects, from grasping a tool to opening a door, requires precise control and adaptation.

-   **Grasping:** Deciding where and how to grasp an object.
    -   **AI Techniques:**
        -   **Deep Learning for Grasp Pose Detection:** Neural networks that take camera images and output optimal grasp poses for various objects.
        -   **Learning from Demonstration (LfD):** Humans teleoperate the robot to perform grasps, and the AI learns the mapping from visual input to motor commands.
-   **In-Hand Manipulation:** Adjusting an object's pose once it's already in the gripper.
    -   **AI Techniques:** RL for learning fine motor skills to re-orient objects without dropping them.

## 4. Reactive Control vs. Deliberative Planning

Robots need to balance immediate reactions with long-term goals.

-   **Reactive Control:** Rapid, low-level responses to sensory input (e.g., immediately shifting weight to recover balance). Often learned directly via RL.
-   **Deliberative Planning:** High-level, slower decision-making to achieve complex goals (e.g., navigating to a room, planning a sequence of actions).
    -   **AI Techniques:** Search algorithms (A*, RRT), symbolic AI, task and motion planning (TAMP) combining AI for high-level logic with classical motion planning.
-   **Hybrid Approaches:** Combining fast, learned reactive policies with slower, classical planners to get the best of both worlds.

## Activity: AI for Bipedal Locomotion

Compare and contrast traditional control methods for bipedal locomotion (e.g., Zero Moment Point (ZMP) control) with AI-driven approaches (e.g., Reinforcement Learning). Discuss:
-   The strengths and weaknesses of each.
-   Why AI-driven methods are becoming more prevalent for dynamic behaviors.
-   What kind of data or reward signals would be critical for an RL agent to learn to walk efficiently.

AI-powered control allows humanoid robots to perform tasks that were once considered impossible, leading to more adaptive, robust, and human-like physical intelligence.
