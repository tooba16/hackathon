**Isaac Orbit** is a powerful, Python-based framework for robotics simulation, with a special focus on **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. It is built on top of Isaac Sim and provides a structured and highly-performant environment for training robotic AI policies.

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by performing actions in an **environment** to maximize a cumulative **reward**.

The core components of an RL problem are:
-   **Agent:** The learner and decision-maker. In our case, the AI policy that controls the robot.
-   **Environment:** The world the agent interacts with. For us, this is the Isaac Sim simulation of our robot and its surroundings.
-   **State (or Observation):** A snapshot of the environment that the agent can see. This could be the robot's joint positions, velocities, IMU readings, or camera images.
-   **Action:** A decision made by the agent. This could be the torques to apply to each joint or the target position for a joint.
-   **Reward:** A scalar feedback signal. The reward tells the agent how good its last action was. The agent's goal is to learn a **policy** (a mapping from state to action) that maximizes the total reward over time.

Instead of programming a robot to "walk," you reward it for moving forward and penalize it for falling down. Through millions of trials in simulation, the AI agent learns the complex sequence of actions that constitutes walking.

## The Isaac Orbit Framework

Isaac Orbit provides a set of building blocks specifically designed for robot RL:

-   **Environments:** Pre-built environments for common robotics tasks (e.g., reaching, lifting, mobile manipulation).
-   **Robot Models:** Pre-configured interfaces for various robots.
-   **Sensors:** An API for adding and configuring sensors like cameras and IMUs within the RL environment.
-   **Task Definitions:** A clear structure for defining the core RL components:
    -   `set_up_scene()`: Where you define the layout of your simulation world.
    -   `_compute_observations()`: Where you define the state vector.
    -   `_compute_rewards()`: Where you define the reward function.
-   **Trainers:** Scripts that integrate with popular RL libraries (like `rsl_rl`) to run the training process.

## Practical Activity

**Install and Run an Example Environment:**

Isaac Orbit is designed to be installed as a Python package in a Conda environment. The official documentation provides the most up-to-date installation instructions.

1.  **Follow the official Isaac Orbit installation guide.** This will involve cloning the repository and running an installation script.
2.  **Run a pre-built example:** Isaac Orbit comes with many examples. Let's run the one for the Franka robot arm.
    ```bash
    # Make sure your conda environment is activated
    # The exact command might differ based on your setup
    python -m orbit.examples.rmp.franka_cartesian_rmp --task Reach --num_envs 64
    ```
    -   This command launches an Isaac Sim environment.
    -   `--num_envs 64`: This is a key feature. It creates 64 copies of the environment that are all simulated in parallel on the GPU. This is how RL can collect massive amounts of experience so quickly.

You will see 64 robot arms all trying to reach a target simultaneously. This demonstrates the massive parallelism that is at the core of Isaac Orbit's performance. In the next lesson, we will create our own custom environment for our humanoid robot.
