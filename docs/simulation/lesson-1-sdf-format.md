## From Description to Simulation

In the previous chapter, we used the **Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)** to describe the kinematic and visual properties of our robot. While URDF is excellent for modeling a single robot, it has limitations when it comes to describing an entire simulation environment.

**URDF Limitations:**
- **Single Robot Only:** URDF cannot describe non-robot objects like tables, walls, or lights.
- **Limited Physics:** It has limited tags for specifying advanced physics properties like friction, damping, or contact parameters.
- **No World Description:** A URDF file cannot define the global simulation properties, such as the sky, lighting conditions, or gravity.

## Enter SDF

The **Simulation Description Format (SDF)** is an XML format designed by Open Robotics to describe everything in a simulation: robots, environments, and physics. It is the native format for Gazebo.

**Key Advantages of SDF:**
- **Complete World Description:** SDF can specify everything from the physics engine properties to the placement of multiple robots and objects.
- **Rich Physics Properties:** Provides detailed control over friction, damping, contact stiffness, and more.
- **Built-in Sensor Models:** Natively supports the definition of complex sensors with plugins.
- **Self-Contained:** An SDF file can contain all the information needed to spawn a model, including its visual meshes and plugin configurations.

## Converting URDF to SDF

Gazebo provides a command-line tool to perform a basic conversion from URDF to SDF. This is a useful starting point, though you will often need to manually edit the resulting SDF to add more detail.

```bash
# In a terminal where Gazebo is sourced
gz sdf -p my_robot.urdf > my_robot.sdf
```

The primary change you'll notice is that the structure is more nested, with explicit tags for `<model>`, `<link>`, `<collision>`, `<visual>`, and `<inertial>`.

## Practical Activity

1.  **Locate the URDF file** for the simple robotic arm you created in Chapter 2.
2.  **Run the conversion command:**
    ```bash
    gz sdf -p simple_arm.urdf > simple_arm.sdf
    ```
3.  **Inspect the `simple_arm.sdf` file.** Compare its structure to the original URDF. Note the addition of `<model>` tags and how the joint properties are defined.

In the next lesson, we will use the principles of SDF to build a complete world file from scratch.
