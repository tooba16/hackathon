## Overview of UI Technologies

In this lesson, we'll explore various UI frameworks and technologies that are commonly used in robotics applications. The right UI framework can make a significant difference in how operators interact with robotic systems.

### Common UI Technologies for Robotics:

1. **Web-based interfaces** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
2. **Desktop applications** (Qt, Electron)
3. **Mobile applications** (React Native, Flutter)
4. **Specialized visualization tools** (RViz, custom dashboards)
5. **Virtual/Augmented Reality** (Unity, Unreal Engine)

### Learning Objectives:

- Understand different UI options for robotics
- Compare web vs. native interfaces for robotics applications
- Identify appropriate UI technology for your use case
