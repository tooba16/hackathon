## Building Web UIs for Robot Control

Web-based interfaces have become increasingly popular for robotics applications due to their accessibility and cross-platform compatibility. In this lesson, we'll explore how to create effective web interfaces for robot monitoring and control.

### Key Technologies:

1. **React.js** - Component-based UI library
2. **WebSocket connections** - For real-time communication
3. **D3.js** - For data visualization
4. **Three.js** - For 3D robot visualization
5. **Bootstrap/Material UI** - For responsive design

### Benefits of Web-Based UIs:

- Accessible from any device with a browser
- No installation required for users
- Easy to update and maintain
- Good for remote operations

### Learning Objectives:

- Create a basic web interface for robot monitoring
- Implement real-time data visualization
- Design responsive interfaces for robotics applications
