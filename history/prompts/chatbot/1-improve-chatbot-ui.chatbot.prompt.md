# Improve Chatbot UI

## Prompt

## Response

The chatbot UI has been updated to incorporate the project's black and gold theme, including an image, improved colors, and enhanced interactive elements.
This involved:

*   Adding a `robot-head.svg` icon to the header.
*   Implementing subtle `linear-gradient` backgrounds for the main container and chat area.
*   Refining the mode selector's appearance.
*   Applying `border-radius` and adjusting spacing for messages.
*   Enhancing the input field with focus styles.
*   Improving the send button's look with gradients, shadows, and more pronounced hover effects.
*   Adding a simple blinking dots animation for the loading indicator.
