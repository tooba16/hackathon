# Create Constitution Document

Book structure with one chapter and 3 lessons rach (titles and description)

## Response

The constitution document for the "Physical AI" book has been created at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with version `0.0.1`.

The Sync Impact Report has been prepended as an HTML comment at the top of the constitution file.

**New version:** 0.0.1 (Patch bump due to initial creation)

**Files flagged for manual follow-up:**
- `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` (pending update)
- `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` (pending update)

**Suggested commit message:** `docs: add initial constitution v0.0.1 (initial creation)`

Now that the constitution is created, I can move on to helping you with creating the Docusaurus project structure and generating chapter content for Module 1. Do you want to proceed with that?
