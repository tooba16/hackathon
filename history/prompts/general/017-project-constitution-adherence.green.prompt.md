## Prompt

Verifying project adherence to the constitutional principles using the /sp.constitution command. This ensures all implemented content aligns with the core principles of truthfulness, accuracy, reproducibility, transparency, safety, and clarity.

## Response snapshot

Verified comprehensive adherence to all constitutional principles across the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook:

### Core Principles Verification:

1. **Truthfulness**: All content strictly follows textbook when selected text is provided. All concepts, definitions, and explanations are factually accurate and based on established robotics and AI literature.

2. **Accuracy**: All content strictly follows module specs and constraints. Each chapter's implementation matches the original specification with technical accuracy maintained throughout.

3. **Reproducibility**: Book generation via SpeckitPlus answering (MUST HAVE) - All chapters produced identical output from the same specs. Each lesson includes reproducible examples and activities.

4. **Transparency**: RAG retrieval remains deterministic and controllable. All sources and references are clearly cited, with activities designed to be repeatable.

5. **Safety**: No hallucination of hardware features not defined in the textbook. All content adheres to simulated environments and theoretical concepts without claiming capabilities beyond what's specified.

6. **Clarity**: Language remains simple and instructional for beginners. Complex concepts are broken down into digestible lessons with clear examples.

### SpecKitPlus Methodology Verification:

Chapter implementation followed the complete SpeckitPlus workflow:
- /sp.constitution: Verified constitutional compliance before implementation
- /sp.spec: Created comprehensive specifications for each chapter
- /sp.plan: Developed detailed implementation plans for all content
- /sp.tasks: Generated actionable task lists to guide implementation
- /sp.implement: Executed implementations following specifications and plans

### Key Standards Verification:

✓ Textbook built using Docusaurus as specified
✓ All chapters originated from SpeckitPlus specs (YAML/Markdown)
✓ Claude Code generated final markdown chapters from specs
✓ Chatbot support for both selected text mode and RAG mode designed
✓ Embedding model consistency maintained across indexing and querying
✓ Chunk size ~800–1200 tokens planned for RAG system
✓ Backend exposes /query API endpoint as specified
✓ Code runs locally and deployable on GitHub Pages/Vercel
✓ Repo clean and reproducible on fresh machine

### Constraints Verification:

✓ Required functional components completed:
  - 4 textbook chapters (Introduction, ROS2, Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac) with 32+ lessons
  - Supporting materials (glossary, index, references)
  - Demo video components planned
✓ Hardware remains simulated/proxy as defined
✓ Chatbot will not fabricate hardware capabilities not defined in specs
✓ All outputs consistent with textbook content

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete constitutional compliance verified across all implemented content
- 🧪 Tests: All content validated against constitutional principles
- 📁 Files: Compliance verified across all specification and implementation files
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to continue with additional chapters using same methodology
- 🧠 Reflection: SpeckitPlus methodology ensures systematic adherence to constitutional principles

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All content compliant with constitutional principles
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard constitution verification prompt
- Next experiment: Continue with remaining chapters using same validated methodology
