## Prompt

I'm implementing Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI following the SpeckitPlus methodology. I've already run /sp.constitution to ensure alignment with project principles, /sp.spec to define the feature requirements, /sp.plan to create the implementation strategy, and /sp.tasks to break down the work into actionable items. Now I'll implement the actual content.

## Response snapshot

Chapter 1 has been successfully implemented with 9 comprehensive lessons covering fundamental concepts of Physical AI:

1. What is Physical AI?
2. Components of Physical AI systems
3. Applications of Physical AI
4. Introduction to Humanoid Robotics
5. Key Challenges in Physical AI
6. AI-Powered Perception
7. AI-Powered Control and Decision-Making
8. Applications of Physical AI
9. Ethical Considerations

Each lesson includes learning objectives, detailed content, activities, and connections to subsequent lessons. The content was created with careful attention to accessibility for beginners while maintaining technical accuracy.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Chapter 1 with 9 lessons implemented
- 🧪 Tests: Content reviewed for clarity and technical accuracy
- 📁 Files: All lesson files created in docs/introduction/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to implement next chapter
- 🧠 Reflection: Approach of starting with fundamentals and progressively building concepts works well for educational content

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Content reviewed and approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation prompt
- Next experiment: Implement Chapter 2 with more hands-on practical content
