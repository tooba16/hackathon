## Prompt

Creating the feature specification for Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI using the /sp.spec command. This follows the SpeckitPlus specification-driven development approach to clearly define requirements before implementation.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI. The spec includes:

User Stories:
- Students will understand the definition and characteristics of Physical AI
- Students will differentiate Physical AI from traditional digital AI systems
- Students will identify key components of Physical AI systems
- Students will recognize applications of Physical AI
- Students will understand challenges and ethical considerations in Physical AI

Requirements:
- FR-001: Content must define Physical AI and distinguish from traditional AI
- FR-002: Content must explain four key characteristics of Physical AI systems
- FR-003: Content must compare Physical AI with traditional digital AI systems
- FR-004: Content must cover applications of Physical AI
- FR-005: Content must address ethical considerations in Physical AI

Success Criteria:
- Students can distinguish Physical AI from traditional AI
- Students understand the components necessary for Physical AI systems
- Content is accessible to beginners while maintaining technical accuracy

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete specification for Chapter 1 created
- 🧪 Tests: Specification reviewed for completeness and clarity
- 📁 Files: spec.md created in specs/introduction-to-physical-ai/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to create implementation plan with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Clear specifications help ensure comprehensive educational content

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard specification prompt
