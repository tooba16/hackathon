## Prompt

I'm implementing Chapter 4: The NVIDIA Isaac Platform following the SpeckitPlus methodology. I've already run /sp.constitution to ensure alignment with project principles, /sp.spec to define the feature requirements, /sp.plan to create the implementation strategy, and /sp.tasks to break down the work into actionable items. Now I'll implement the actual content.

## Response snapshot

Chapter 4 has been successfully implemented with 11 comprehensive lessons covering the NVIDIA Isaac platform:

1. The NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem
2. Environment Setup & ROS 2 Bridge
3. Building Scenes with Python Scripting
4. Importing and Controlling a Robot
5. Introduction to Isaac ROS GEMs
6. High-Performance Stereo Vision
7. AI-based Object Detection with AprilTags
8. Introduction to Isaac Orbit
9. Creating a Custom RL Environment
10. Training a Control Policy
11. Deploying the Trained Policy

This chapter provides students with advanced knowledge of NVIDIA's robotics platform, including GPU-accelerated perception and reinforcement learning techniques. The content builds from basic environment setup to complex AI training and deployment workflows.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Chapter 4 with 11 lessons implemented
- 🧪 Tests: Isaac platform examples validated in simulated environments
- 📁 Files: All lesson files created in docs/nvidia-isaac/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to implement next chapter with UI focus
- 🧠 Reflection: Advanced platform-specific content requires detailed, step-by-step instructions

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Content reviewed and approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation prompt
- Next experiment: Implement Chapter 5 focusing on user interfaces for robotics
