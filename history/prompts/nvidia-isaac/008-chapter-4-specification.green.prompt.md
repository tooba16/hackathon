## Prompt

Creating the feature specification for Chapter 4: The NVIDIA Isaac Platform using the /sp.spec command. This follows the SpeckitPlus specification-driven development approach to clearly define requirements before implementation.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Chapter 4: The NVIDIA Isaac Platform. The spec includes:

User Stories:
- Students will understand the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Isaac Orbit)
- Students will set up the Isaac Sim environment and ROS2 bridge
- Students will build scenes programmatically using Isaac Sim Python API
- Students will import and control robots in Isaac Sim
- Students will understand Isaac ROS GEMs for accelerated perception
- Students will implement high-performance stereo vision pipelines
- Students will implement AI-based object detection with AprilTags
- Students will understand Isaac Orbit for reinforcement learning
- Students will create custom RL environments for humanoid robots
- Students will train and deploy control policies for humanoid robots

Requirements:
- FR-001: Content must explain Isaac ecosystem components and integration
- FR-002: Content must provide Isaac Sim setup with ROS2 bridge
- FR-003: Content must demonstrate scene creation with Python API
- FR-004: Content must cover robot import and control methods
- FR-005: Content must introduce Isaac ROS GEMs for perception
- FR-006: Content must implement accelerated stereo vision
- FR-007: Content must demonstrate AprilTag detection and processing
- FR-008: Content must explain Isaac Orbit for RL applications
- FR-009: Content must guide creation of custom RL environments
- FR-010: Content must cover policy training and deployment

Success Criteria:
- Students can set up and use Isaac Sim environment
- Students can implement GPU-accelerated perception pipelines
- Students can create and train RL environments for humanoid robots
- Content includes advanced AI/robotics techniques with practical examples

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete specification for Chapter 4 created
- 🧪 Tests: Specification reviewed for completeness and clarity
- 📁 Files: spec.md created in specs/nvidia-isaac-platform/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to create implementation plan with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Advanced platform-specific content requires detailed, step-by-step specifications

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard specification prompt
- Next experiment: Create detailed implementation plan
