## Prompt

Creating the implementation plan for Chapter 4: The NVIDIA Isaac Platform using the /sp.plan command. This follows the SpeckitPlus methodology to design the approach and project structure before implementation.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Chapter 4: The NVIDIA Isaac Platform:

Technical Context:
- Language/Version: Markdown for content, Python for scripts, Isaac Sim 2023.1.0, Isaac ROS GEMs, Isaac Orbit
- Primary Dependencies: NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, Omniverse, Docusaurus documentation framework
- Storage: Content stored in docs/nvidia-isaac/ directory with Isaac-specific assets
- Testing: Examples tested in Isaac Sim environment with GPU acceleration
- Target Platform: Web-based textbook with Isaac platform requirements
- Project Type: Advanced educational content with GPU-accelerated perception and RL
- Performance Goals: GPU-accelerated examples, RL training demonstrations
- Constraints: Requires NVIDIA GPU and Isaac platform installation
- Scale/Scope: 11 lessons with advanced AI/robotics techniques

Constitution Check:
All content aligns with project principles of truthfulness, accuracy, reproducibility, transparency, safety, and clarity. Advanced platform-specific content requires detailed documentation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan for Chapter 4 created
- 🧪 Tests: Plan reviewed for completeness and feasibility
- 📁 Files: plan.md created in specs/nvidia-isaac-platform/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to generate implementation tasks with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Advanced platform planning ensures comprehensive AI/robotics education

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Plan approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard planning prompt
- Next experiment: Generate detailed implementation tasks
