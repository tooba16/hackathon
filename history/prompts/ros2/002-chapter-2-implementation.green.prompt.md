## Prompt

I'm implementing Chapter 2: ROS2 Fundamentals following the SpeckitPlus methodology. I've already run /sp.constitution to ensure alignment with project principles, /sp.spec to define the feature requirements, /sp.plan to create the implementation strategy, and /sp.tasks to break down the work into actionable items. Now I'll implement the actual content.

## Response snapshot

Chapter 2 has been successfully implemented with 9 comprehensive lessons covering ROS2 fundamentals:

1. Introduction to the ROS 2 Graph
2. Environment Setup
3. Creating Nodes
4. Custom Interfaces
5. Debugging Tools
6. Launch Files
7. URDF Modeling
8. Simulation and Visualization
9. TF2 Transforms

Each lesson balances theoretical concepts with practical implementation activities, providing students with hands-on experience with ROS2 tools and concepts. The content builds progressively from basic graph concepts to complex simulation workflows.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Chapter 2 with 9 lessons implemented
- 🧪 Tests: Practical examples tested in ROS2 Humble environment
- 📁 Files: All lesson files created in docs/ros2/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to implement next chapter with simulation focus
- 🧠 Reflection: Practical examples significantly enhance learning outcomes

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Content reviewed and approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation prompt
- Next experiment: Implement Chapter 3 with advanced simulation techniques
