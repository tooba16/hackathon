## Prompt

Creating the feature specification for Chapter 2: ROS2 Fundamentals using the /sp.spec command. This follows the SpeckitPlus specification-driven development approach to clearly define requirements before implementation.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Chapter 2: ROS2 Fundamentals. The spec includes:

User Stories:
- Students will understand the ROS2 computational graph (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions)
- Students will set up a complete ROS2 development environment
- Students will create and run basic ROS2 nodes
- Students will define custom message and service interfaces
- Students will use debugging and introspection tools
- Students will manage complex applications with launch files
- Students will model robots using URDF
- Students will simulate robots in Gazebo
- Students will work with coordinate transformations using TF2

Requirements:
- FR-001: Content must explain ROS2 computational graph concepts
- FR-002: Content must provide environment setup instructions
- FR-003: Content must demonstrate node creation with code examples
- FR-004: Content must cover custom interfaces with practical examples
- FR-005: Content must include debugging tools and techniques
- FR-006: Content must explain launch files for complex applications
- FR-007: Content must cover robot modeling with URDF
- FR-008: Content must demonstrate Gazebo simulation
- FR-009: Content must explain TF2 transformations

Success Criteria:
- Students can create basic ROS2 nodes and topics
- Students can model a simple robot with URDF
- Students can simulate a robot in Gazebo
- Content includes practical, testable examples

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete specification for Chapter 2 created
- 🧪 Tests: Specification reviewed for completeness and clarity
- 📁 Files: spec.md created in specs/ros2-fundamentals/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to create implementation plan with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: ROS2 fundamentals form the foundation for all subsequent robotics work

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard specification prompt
- Next experiment: Create detailed implementation plan
