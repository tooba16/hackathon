## Prompt

Creating the implementation plan for Chapter 2: ROS2 Fundamentals using the /sp.plan command. This follows the SpeckitPlus methodology to design the approach and project structure before implementation.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Chapter 2: ROS2 Fundamentals:

Technical Context:
- Language/Version: Markdown for content, Python for code examples, ROS2 Humble Hawksbill
- Primary Dependencies: ROS2 ecosystem, Docusaurus documentation framework
- Storage: Content stored in docs/ros2/ directory with code examples
- Testing: Code examples tested in ROS2 environment
- Target Platform: Web-based textbook with downloadable code examples
- Project Type: Educational content with hands-on ROS2 exercises
- Performance Goals: Executable examples, clear explanations of complex concepts
- Constraints: Examples must work in standard ROS2 installation
- Scale/Scope: 9 lessons with practical exercises and code examples

Constitution Check:
All content aligns with project principles of truthfulness, accuracy, reproducibility, transparency, safety, and clarity. Code examples follow ROS2 best practices.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan for Chapter 2 created
- 🧪 Tests: Plan reviewed for completeness and feasibility
- 📁 Files: plan.md created in specs/ros2-fundamentals/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to generate implementation tasks with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning for technical content ensures practical, executable examples

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Plan approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard planning prompt
- Next experiment: Generate detailed implementation tasks
