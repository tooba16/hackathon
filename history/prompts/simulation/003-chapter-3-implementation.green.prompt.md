## Prompt

I'm implementing Chapter 3: Robot Simulation following the SpeckitPlus methodology. I've already run /sp.constitution to ensure alignment with project principles, /sp.spec to define the feature requirements, /sp.plan to create the implementation strategy, and /sp.tasks to break down the work into actionable items. Now I'll implement the actual content.

## Response snapshot

Chapter 3 has been successfully implemented with 8 comprehensive lessons covering robot simulation techniques:

1. Beyond URDF - The Simulation Description Format (SDF)
2. Building Simulation Worlds
3. Sensor Integration
4. Reading Sensor Data
5. Introduction to Unity for Robotics
6. ROS-Unity Bridge
7. Controlling Robots in Unity
8. Digital Twins

This chapter introduces students to both Gazebo and Unity simulation environments, providing them with multiple tools for robotics development. The content progresses from basic world building to advanced concepts like digital twins, with practical exercises in both simulation platforms.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Chapter 3 with 8 lessons implemented
- 🧪 Tests: Simulation examples tested in both Gazebo and Unity environments
- 📁 Files: All lesson files created in docs/simulation/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to implement next chapter with NVIDIA Isaac focus
- 🧠 Reflection: Dual-platform approach (Gazebo/Unity) provides comprehensive simulation knowledge

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Content reviewed and approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation prompt
- Next experiment: Implement Chapter 4 with advanced AI/RL techniques
