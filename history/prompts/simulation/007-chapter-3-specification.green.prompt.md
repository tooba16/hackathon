## Prompt

Creating the feature specification for Chapter 3: Robot Simulation using the /sp.spec command. This follows the SpeckitPlus specification-driven development approach to clearly define requirements before implementation.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Chapter 3: Robot Simulation. The spec includes:

User Stories:
- Students will understand SDF format and its advantages over URDF for simulation
- Students will create custom simulation worlds with Gazebo
- Students will integrate various sensors into robot models
- Students will read and process sensor data from simulated robots
- Students will understand Unity as a robotics simulation platform
- Students will establish communication between ROS2 and Unity
- Students will control simulated robots in Unity environment
- Students will understand digital twin concepts
- Students will compare different simulation platforms

Requirements:
- FR-001: Content must explain SDF format and conversion from URDF
- FR-002: Content must demonstrate building custom Gazebo worlds
- FR-003: Content must cover sensor integration in simulation
- FR-004: Content must show how to read sensor data from simulation
- FR-005: Content must introduce Unity for robotics applications
- FR-006: Content must explain ROS2-Unity bridge setup
- FR-007: Content must demonstrate robot control in Unity
- FR-008: Content must explain digital twin concepts and applications
- FR-009: Content must compare simulation platform tradeoffs

Success Criteria:
- Students can create custom simulation environments in Gazebo
- Students can integrate and read data from various sensors
- Students can establish ROS2-Unity communication
- Content provides hands-on experience with multiple platforms

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete specification for Chapter 3 created
- 🧪 Tests: Specification reviewed for completeness and clarity
- 📁 Files: spec.md created in specs/robot-simulation/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to create implementation plan with /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Multiple simulation platforms provide comprehensive understanding

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard specification prompt
- Next experiment: Create detailed implementation plan
