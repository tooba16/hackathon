## Prompt

Creating the implementation plan for Chapter 3: Robot Simulation using the /sp.plan command. This follows the SpeckitPlus methodology to design the approach and project structure before implementation.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Chapter 3: Robot Simulation:

Technical Context:
- Language/Version: Markdown for content, XML for SDF/URDF, Python for control scripts, Unity 2022.3 LTS
- Primary Dependencies: Gazebo simulation, Unity robotics tools, Docusaurus documentation framework
- Storage: Content stored in docs/simulation/ directory with configuration files
- Testing: Simulation examples tested in both Gazebo and Unity environments
- Target Platform: Web-based textbook with downloadable simulation assets
- Project Type: Educational content with multi-platform simulation examples
- Performance Goals: Executable simulation examples, clear platform comparisons
- Constraints: Examples must work in both Gazebo and Unity environments
- Scale/Scope: 8 lessons with practical simulation exercises

Constitution Check:
All content aligns with project principles of truthfulness, accuracy, reproducibility, transparency, safety, and clarity. Multi-platform approach provides comprehensive simulation knowledge.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan for Chapter 3 created
- 🧪 Tests: Plan reviewed for completeness and feasibility
- 📁 Files: plan.md created in specs/robot-simulation/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to generate implementation tasks with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Multi-platform planning ensures comprehensive simulation education

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Plan approved
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard planning prompt
- Next experiment: Generate detailed implementation tasks
