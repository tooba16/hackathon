# Implementation Plan: Introduction to Physical AI

**Branch**: `001-introduction-to-physical-ai` | **Date**: 2025-05-12 | **Spec**: [link](specs/introduction-to-physical-ai/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/introduction-to-physical-ai/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Based on the feature spec, the primary requirement is to create an introductory chapter that explains Physical AI fundamentals, distinguishing it from traditional digital AI, and covering key components, applications, challenges, and ethical considerations. The technical approach will involve creating educational content that is accessible to beginners while maintaining technical accuracy.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown for content, adhering to Docusaurus standards
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus documentation framework
**Storage**: Content stored in docs/introduction/ directory
**Testing**: Content reviewed for technical accuracy and pedagogical effectiveness
**Target Platform**: Web-based textbook using Docusaurus
**Project Type**: Educational content with examples and activities
**Performance Goals**: Fast-loading pages, accessible content
**Constraints**: Content must be accessible to beginners while accurate for advanced users
**Scale/Scope**: 9 lessons with examples, activities, and learning objectives

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All content aligns with project principles of truthfulness, accuracy, reproducibility, transparency, safety, and clarity.
