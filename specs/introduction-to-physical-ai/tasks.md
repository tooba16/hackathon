## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all lessons
- **Lessons (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Lessons can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired lessons being complete

### Lesson Dependencies

- **Lesson 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other lessons
- **Lesson 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with L1 but should be independently testable
- **Lesson 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with L1/L2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each Lesson

- Core content before activities
- Learning objectives before content
- Theory before practical examples
- Lesson complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all lessons can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Lessons 1-2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all lessons)
3. Complete Phase 3: Lesson 1
4. Complete Phase 4: Lesson 2
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test first two lessons independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add Lesson 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add Lesson 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add Lesson 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each lesson adds value without breaking previous lessons

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: Lessons 1 & 4
   - Developer B: Lessons 2 & 5
   - Developer C: Lessons 3 & 6
3. Lessons complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Lesson] label maps task to specific lesson for traceability
- Each lesson should be independently completable and testable
- Verify content accuracy before implementation
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate lesson independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-lesson dependencies that break independence
