# Implementation Plan: NVIDIA Isaac Platform

**Branch**: `004-nvidia-isaac-platform` | **Date**: 2025-08-17 | **Spec**: [link](specs/nvidia-isaac-platform/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/nvidia-isaac-platform/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Based on the feature spec, the primary requirement is to create a comprehensive chapter covering the NVIDIA Isaac platform including Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS GEMs, and Isaac Orbit for robotics development with GPU-accelerated perception and reinforcement learning. The technical approach will involve creating practical examples that leverage GPU acceleration.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown for content, Python for scripts, Isaac Sim 2023.1.0, Isaac ROS GEMs, Isaac Orbit
**Primary Dependencies**: NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, Omniverse, Docusaurus documentation framework
**Storage**: Content stored in docs/nvidia-isaac/ directory with Isaac-specific assets
**Testing**: Examples tested in Isaac Sim environment with GPU acceleration
**Target Platform**: Web-based textbook with Isaac platform requirements
**Project Type**: Advanced educational content with GPU-accelerated perception and RL
**Performance Goals**: GPU-accelerated examples, RL training demonstrations
**Constraints**: Requires NVIDIA GPU and Isaac platform installation
**Scale/Scope**: 11 lessons with advanced AI/robotics techniques

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All content aligns with project principles of truthfulness, accuracy, reproducibility, transparency, safety, and clarity. Advanced platform-specific content requires detailed documentation.
