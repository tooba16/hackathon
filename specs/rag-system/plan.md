# RAG System Implementation Plan

## 1. Scope and Dependencies

### In Scope
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system implementation
- Cohere API integration for embeddings and text generation
- Qdrant vector database integration
- Flask-based REST API
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Support for chat, translate, and explain modes

### Out of Scope
- Frontend development
- Initial content ingestion into Qdrant
- Infrastructure deployment
- Authentication system

### External Dependencies
- **Cohere API**: For embeddings and language model generation
  - Responsibility: External Cohere service
- **Qdrant Cloud**: For vector storage and retrieval
  - Responsibility: External Qdrant service
- **Python 3.8+**: Runtime environment
  - Responsibility: Development team
- **Flask**: Web framework
  - Responsibility: Development team

## 2. Key Decisions and Rationale

### Decision 1: Use of Cohere for NLP tasks
- **Options Considered**: OpenAI API, Hugging Face models, Cohere API
- **Trade-offs**: 
  - Cohere: Good performance, easy integration, paid model
  - OpenAI: Good performance, good integration, paid model
  - Hugging Face: Free models, more complex integration, self-hosted
- **Rationale**: Cohere provides excellent performance for embeddings and generation with straightforward API integration

### Decision 2: Vector Database Selection
- **Options Considered**: Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Qdrant: Good performance, both cloud and open-source options, good Python client
  - Pinecone: Managed service, good performance, more expensive
  - Weaviate: Good features, GraphQL support, less mature client
- **Rationale**: Qdrant offers a good balance of performance, cost, and flexibility with both cloud and self-hosted options

### Decision 3: API Architecture
- **Options Considered**: REST API, GraphQL, gRPC
- **Trade-offs**:
  - REST: Simple, well-understood, good tooling
  - GraphQL: Flexible queries, more complex to implement
  - gRPC: High performance, more complex for web clients
- **Rationale**: REST API is the most suitable for a web-based textbook application with broad tooling support

### Principles
- Minimal viable implementation first
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements
- Proper error handling and graceful degradation
- Security by design (API key management)

## 3. Interfaces and API Contracts

### Public APIs

#### POST /ask
**Purpose**: Submit a question to the AI tutor

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "query": "string (required) - The question to ask",
  "mode": "string (optional, default: 'chat') - One of 'chat', 'translate', 'explain'",
  "collection": "string (optional, default: 'physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook') - Qdrant collection name",
  "limit": "integer (optional, default: 5) - Number of results to retrieve (1-100)"
}
```

**Success Response (200)**:
```json
{
  "query": "string - The original question",
  "mode": "string - The mode used",
  "answer": "string - The AI's response",
  "collection": "string - The collection used",
  "limit": "integer - The limit used"
}
```

**Error Response (400, 401, 500)**:
```json
{
  "error": "string - Error message"
}
```

#### GET /health
**Purpose**: Check the health status of the service

**Success Response (200)**:
```json
{
  "status": "string - Service status (healthy, warning, error)",
  "message": "string - Status message",
  "timestamp": "string - ISO 8601 formatted timestamp"
}
```

#### GET /
**Purpose**: Get API documentation

**Success Response (200)**:
```json
{
  "message": "string - Welcome message",
  "version": "string - API version",
  "api_key_status": "string - API key status",
  "endpoints": "object - API endpoint documentation"
}
```

### Versioning Strategy
- API versioning through path: `/v1/ask`, `/v2/ask` in future
- Backward compatibility maintained for minor versions

### Error Taxonomy
- 400: Client error (malformed request, invalid parameters)
- 401: Authentication error (invalid API key)
- 404: Resource not found
- 500: Server error (internal processing error)

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements and Budgets

### Performance
- **p95 latency**: < 3 seconds for query responses
- **Throughput**: Support up to 100 concurrent users
- **Resource caps**: < 2GB memory under normal load

### Reliability
- **SLO**: 99% uptime during business hours
- **Error budget**: 1% allowed downtime
- **Degradation strategy**: Fallback to mock responses when external APIs unavailable

### Security
- **AuthN**: API key in environment variables
- **AuthZ**: No user-specific permissions (public textbook)
- **Data handling**: No user data stored
- **Auditing**: Log all requests for debugging

### Cost
- **Cohere API**: Estimated cost based on usage tier
- **Qdrant**: Cloud tier based on storage and requests
- **Hosting**: Server costs based on compute and bandwidth

## 5. Data Management and Migration

### Source of Truth
- The Qdrant vector database contains the textbook content
- Original content sources are maintained separately

### Schema Evolution
- Vector schemas managed by Qdrant
- API response schemas documented in this specification

### Migration Plan
- Initial content ingestion handled separately
- Schema changes will follow API versioning

## 6. Operational Readiness

### Observability
- **Logs**: All requests and errors logged to standard output
- **Metrics**: Response times and error rates monitored
- **Traces**: Request flow tracing for performance debugging

### Alerting
- **Thresholds**: Alert on >5% error rate
- **On-call**: Development team for initial phase

### Runbooks
- Common error troubleshooting
- API key rotation procedure
- Performance degradation handling

### Deployment Strategy
- Blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- Configuration through environment variables
- Feature flags for new functionality

## 7. Risk Analysis and Mitigation

### Top 3 Risks

**Risk 1**: External API Unavailability (Cohere/Qdrant)
- **Blast Radius**: Complete service outage
- **Mitigation**: Fallback responses, comprehensive error handling
- **Kill Switch**: Ability to disable external API calls

**Risk 2**: API Cost Overruns
- **Blast Radius**: Budget impact
- **Mitigation**: Usage monitoring and rate limiting
- **Guardrails**: Configurable request limits

**Risk 3**: Security Breach (API Key Exposure)
- **Blast Radius**: Financial impact, potential data exposure
- **Mitigation**: Proper key management, monitoring
- **Kill Switch**: Immediate key rotation capability
