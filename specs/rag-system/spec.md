# RAG System Specification for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This specification defines the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. The RAG system enables an AI tutor to answer questions by retrieving relevant content from the textbook and generating contextually appropriate responses.

### 1.2 Scope
The RAG system encompasses:
- Vector storage and retrieval of textbook content
- Natural language processing for question understanding
- AI-powered response generation
- API endpoints for client integration
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Content Retrieval
- **REQ-RAG-001**: The system SHALL store textbook content in a vector database (Qdrant)
- **REQ-RAG-002**: The system SHALL convert user queries to vector embeddings using Cohere's embedding model
- **REQ-RAG-003**: The system SHALL retrieve the top 5 most relevant content chunks based on semantic similarity
- **REQ-RAG-004**: The system SHALL include source URLs with retrieved content when available

### 2.2 Question Answering
- **REQ-RAG-005**: The system SHALL support three question answering modes: 'chat', 'translate', and 'explain'
- **REQ-RAG-006**: In 'chat' mode, the system SHALL use retrieved content to answer questions
- **REQ-RAG-007**: In 'translate' mode, the system SHALL translate text between English and Urdu
- **REQ-RAG-008**: In 'explain' mode, the system SHALL provide detailed explanations of technical terms
- **REQ-RAG-009**: When content is not found, the system SHALL respond appropriately without hallucinating information

### 2.3 API Interface
- **REQ-RAG-010**: The system SHALL provide a REST API endpoint at `/ask` for question submission
- **REQ-RAG-011**: The system SHALL provide a health check endpoint at `/health`
- **REQ-RAG-012**: The system SHALL accept JSON requests with 'query' and optional 'mode' fields
- **REQ-RAG-013**: The system SHALL return JSON responses with the answer and metadata

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- **REQ-RAG-014**: The system SHALL respond to queries within 5 seconds under normal load
- **REQ-RAG-015**: The system SHALL support concurrent requests from multiple users

### 3.2 Reliability
- **REQ-RAG-016**: The system SHALL provide fallback responses when external APIs are unavailable
- **REQ-RAG-017**: The system SHALL handle network interruptions gracefully
- **REQ-RAG-018**: The system SHALL log errors for debugging and monitoring

### 3.3 Security
- **REQ-RAG-019**: The system SHALL securely store and access API keys using environment variables
- **REQ-RAG-020**: The system SHALL validate all incoming requests to prevent injection attacks

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Components
1. **Agent Module**: Core logic for processing queries and generating responses
2. **Qdrant Client Wrapper**: Interface for vector database operations
3. **Cohere Integration**: Natural language processing and generation
4. **Server API**: Flask-based REST interface
5. **Embedding Generator**: Text-to-vector conversion

### 4.2 Data Flow
1. User submits query to the `/ask` endpoint
2. Server validates the request and parameters
3. Agent retrieves relevant content using vector similarity search
4. Cohere generates contextually appropriate response
5. Server returns response to the client

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

### 5.1 Content Retrieval
- [ ] System can retrieve relevant textbook content based on natural language queries
- [ ] Retrieved content includes proper source attribution when available
- [ ] System returns appropriate responses when no relevant content is found

### 5.2 Question Answering
- [ ] System correctly handles all three modes ('chat', 'translate', 'explain')
- [ ] Responses are contextually relevant and accurate
- [ ] System provides meaningful error messages when APIs are unavailable

### 5.3 API Functionality
- [ ] API endpoints return expected responses according to specification
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for invalid inputs
- [ ] Health check endpoint accurately reports system status
