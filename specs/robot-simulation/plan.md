# Implementation Plan: Robot Simulation

**Branch**: `003-robot-simulation` | **Date**: 2025-07-03 | **Spec**: [link](specs/robot-simulation/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/robot-simulation/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Based on the feature spec, the primary requirement is to create a comprehensive chapter covering robot simulation techniques using both Gazebo and Unity, including SDF format, world building, sensor integration, and digital twin concepts. The technical approach will involve creating practical examples for both simulation platforms.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown for content, XML for SDF/URDF, Python for control scripts, Unity 2022.3 LTS
**Primary Dependencies**: Gazebo simulation, Unity robotics tools, Docusaurus documentation framework
**Storage**: Content stored in docs/simulation/ directory with configuration files
**Testing**: Simulation examples tested in both Gazebo and Unity environments
**Target Platform**: Web-based textbook with downloadable simulation assets
**Project Type**: Educational content with multi-platform simulation examples
**Performance Goals**: Executable simulation examples, clear platform comparisons
**Constraints**: Examples must work in both Gazebo and Unity environments
**Scale/Scope**: 8 lessons with practical simulation exercises

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All content aligns with project principles of truthfulness, accuracy, reproducibility, transparency, safety, and clarity. Multi-platform approach provides comprehensive simulation knowledge.
