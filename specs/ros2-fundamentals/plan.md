# Implementation Plan: ROS2 Fundamentals

**Branch**: `002-ros2-fundamentals` | **Date**: 2025-06-07 | **Spec**: [link](specs/ros2-fundamentals/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/ros2-fundamentals/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Based on the feature spec, the primary requirement is to create a comprehensive chapter covering ROS2 fundamentals including the computational graph, environment setup, node creation, custom interfaces, debugging tools, launch files, URDF modeling, simulation visualization, and TF2 transforms. The technical approach will involve creating practical, hands-on lessons with executable examples.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown for content, Python for code examples, ROS2 Humble Hawksbill
**Primary Dependencies**: ROS2 ecosystem, Docusaurus documentation framework
**Storage**: Content stored in docs/ros2/ directory with code examples
**Testing**: Code examples tested in ROS2 environment
**Target Platform**: Web-based textbook with downloadable code examples
**Project Type**: Educational content with hands-on ROS2 exercises
**Performance Goals**: Executable examples, clear explanations of complex concepts
**Constraints**: Examples must work in standard ROS2 installation
**Scale/Scope**: 9 lessons with practical exercises and code examples

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All content aligns with project principles of truthfulness, accuracy, reproducibility, transparency, safety, and clarity. Code examples follow ROS2 best practices.
